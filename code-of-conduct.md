CoderDojo Denver is a community intended to grow the number of young students in STEM+computing. We expect all participants to be kind, considerate, and respectful within our community. This code of conduct applies to participants of all ages, all CoderDojo Denver events and spaces, online and off, public and private.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community. We will not tolerate harassment in any form.

Harassment includes:
---
- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, physical appearance, age, body size, mental illness and/or disability
- Threats of violence
- Use of sexual language or imagery at any time
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or events
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior

We expect all community members to be respectful of others, their time, and resources. Being a participant in this community does not guarantee or entitle you to specific help, time or resources from community leaders or participants.

Reporting
---
If you feel unsafe or unwelcome, or notice that someone else is being harassed, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report by submitting information through our [incident report form](https://forms.gle/By17qNC2DxefyrA1A), sending an email to [admin@rowschool.com](mailto:admin@rowschool.com?subject=Code of Conduct Incident Report), or speaking with one of the organizers of the event you are attending.

We expect event organizers and volunteers to be alert and take appropriate action to intervene in preventing or stopping harassment and unacceptable behavior.

While this code of conduct applies to Row School events and spaces, if you are being harassed by a community member outside our community, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by community members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. Row School reserves the right to refuse an individual's attendance to its events or spaces based on the individuals previous behavior at our events or other non-Row School events and spaces and behavior towards people who are not a part of Row School.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom weâ€™ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Consequences
---
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, community organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the community a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund (for paid events).
