## Code of Conduct

We follow the [CoderDojo Charter](https://coderdojo.com/en/charter) and adhere to our own [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

## Text Markup

This project uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as a form of text markup.

If you're writing something without tables, you can [use Markdown](https://github.com/lifeparticle/Markdown-Cheatsheet). It provides an easy and quick way to create formatted text with lists and nicely formatted code examples. Here is a good [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can include HTML in your Markdown pages. If you're writing something with tables, please use semantic, accessible (a11y) markup (e.g., if you have an image that requires a licensing notice or a citation).
